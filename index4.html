			<h5>About Troop 2</h5>
			    <img src="imgs/barton_circle.JPG" style="float:left; padding-right:6px;"><p>Formed in 1916 with the Reverend H.J. Condit of the First Congregational Church as the first Scoutmaster, Troop 2 has, apart from a few years around the 2nd World War,
			        nearly ninety years as an active unit offering great opportunities for self-improvement and learning to boys in the Ithaca area. Weekly meetings are held during the school
				year at our sponsoring organization, First Congregational Church, 309 Highland Rd in Ithaca (get directions). 2019 saw more campouts and biking trips, another great summer at
				Camp Barton, plenty of outdoor fun and activities as well as the advancement of our 47th Eagle Scout since 1972. We are compiling a troop history and would be pleased to
				receive any information or photos to fill in the gaps, names of scoutmasters, Eagle scouts etc.  See Scouting in Ithaca.pdf</p>
			    
				<h5>Our Program</h5>
				</br>
				<img src="imgs/Kiwi.jpg" style="float:right; padding-left:6px;"><p style="height: 217px">A typical year includes taking part in the Baden Powell Council organized Klondike Derby at Camp Barton and camping out at the coldest time of year, often down to -12 degrees Farenheit.
				Other events include a Memorial day weekend trip to somewhere interesting like Gettysburg, Philadelphia and Valley Forge or to Saratoga and historic Albany, white water rafting,
				summer camp, laser tag, science museum visit, all season backpacking and camping and, of course, our regular weekly meetings including patrol leader's councils and courts of honor.
				Training for scouts and leaders is an important part of our annual program.</p>
			
			    
				</br>
			
			    
				<h5>Summer Camp</h5>
				<img src="imgs/lean-to.jpg" style="float:left; padding-right:6px;"><p>Traditionally taking place during the first week in July at Camp Barton, alongside beautiful Cayuga Lake, our summer camp provides fantastic fun and learning opportunities.
				Courses on offer include archery, basketry, wilderness survival, bird study, canoeing, rifle shooting, reptile and amphibian study and helmsmanship. The scouts and leaders spend
				the week together, forming close ties of trust and understanding to last throughout the scouting year. Each year everyone takes a break to go down to Cass Park, eat ice cream and
				watch the July 4th fireworks display on Ithaca South Hill.</p>

			    	</br>

			    	<p>Summer camp is a great place to make friends and spend a week out in the open.</p>

				<h5>Philmont Scout Ranch</h5>
				<img src="imgs/Philmont2011-2015.jpg" style="float:right; padding-left:6px;"></br>
				<p> Our troop is fortunate to have made a number of trips to Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. In 2011 and 2015 we combined those trek with hikes in the Grand Canyon in Arizona. 
				In 2011 we went to the bottom and stayed at Phantom Ranch, and then returned to the South Rim;  4500 foot down, and 4500 foot up, over 10 miles. In 2015 we divided in two 
				groups with one going from the north rim to the south rim, and the other going the opposite direction: a Rim-to-Rim adventure, The two groups camped together for the night at 
				Phantom Ranch. Both were awesome experiences. Philmont Scout Ranch has for years been the Boy Scout premier high adventure base in Newx Mexico. Treks are 10 nights on the trail. 
				Crews carry their own dehydrated food with two picks opportunities. Troops select routes generally cover 60-80 miles, with side trips easily taking the total mileage to 100 miles. 
				One starts climbing from perhaps 7000 feet, and you go to the top from there. Our treks have taken us over the famous Tooth-of-Time, over Mt Baldy (12,400 feet), and Mt. Philips 
				(11,700 feet). Adventures have included rock climbing, spar pole climbing, team challenge events, conservation projects, black smithing, tour inside a gold mine, homesteading 
				and animal care, mountain-man life, burro racing, hatch throwing, geologic explorations, black-powder rifle, shotgun, and skeet shooting. Rain often included. </p>
			    
				<p>Ours have been tremendous mountain-top experiences with memories for a lifetime.</p>

				<h5>Training</h5>
				<img src="imgs/colonials.jpg" style="float:left; padding-right:6px;"></br>
				<p>Troop 2 has an ongoing commitment to training, we run junior leader training for the younger scouts wishing to take on positions of responsibility and regular meetings based
			    training to enable boys to become troop guides, junior assistant scoutmaster, quartermaster, scribe etc. Adult training includes basic leader training, mandatory for anyone wishing
			    to spend time in a leadership position with the troop, outdoor skills training, first aid and CPR. The Wood Badge program is available for those wishing to take the ultimate in scout
			    leadership training. See backpacking presentation for tips on getting prepared.</p>
			
			    <p>Both Scouts and their parents can become great leaders.</p>
				
				<h5>Seabase Trip 2009</h5>
<p>


</p>
				<img src="imgs/seabase/1_sm.jpg" style="float:right; padding-left:6px;"></br>
				<p>On August 11th, a crew of 5 scouts with their two adults in tow, left the landlocked streets of Ithaca for adventures in the warm, sunny Florida Keys at Seabase. 
				The first days were spent exploring Miami and the Keys, with a full day in Key West and dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe. After these two sweltering days on the mosquito infested 
				land, they boarded their valiant sailing ship the Midnight Dragon with Captain Jim to explore the wonders of the sea. Days were spent learning the finer points of sailing and 
				navigating, snorkeling in the clear blue waters, or just soaking up the rays on the deck of the boat. A midweek stop at Seabase provided the opportunity for kayaking, small boat 
				sailing, and tubing! Two more days at sea and the time ended with the final luau. </p>
				
				<p>A brief stop at an alligator farm on the way to the airport completed the adventure.</p>

				<h5>Join the Troop</h5>
			       <p> To join the Troop a scout needs to fill out a BSA registration form and the attached BSA medical form. Special medical forms are required for summer camp; permission slips are 
				   needed for out-of-council events.<span lang="en-us"> (<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;

				   <a href="mailto:ithacatroop2@gmail.com">
				   ithacatroop2@gmail.com</a></span>) </span>Annual dues are $40 for scouts in the fall 
							payable in September, and $50 in the spring unless 
							covered by participation in Troop Fund raisers. A 
							scout<span lang="en-us">'s </span>dues cover a 
							subscription to Boys Life magazine. Dues cover only 
							about half of our costs for each scout. (Costs 
							include National dues and insurance Boys Life, some 
							camping fees, and costs for awards, training &amp; 
							equipment). To cover the remainder of its costs the 
							Troop participates in several fund raising 
							activities during the year. Popcorn and holiday 
							wreath sales have been the most successful. Scouts 
							who participate in fundraising activities earn 
							credit into their <span lang="en-us">&quot;scout 
							account&quot;,</span> generally 20% of gross sales. This 
							scout account is used to pay the spring dues of $50 
							if sufficient. Additional credit can be use for 
							Summer camp feds, or costs of other activities The 
							cost of trips and equipment should not prevent 
							scouts from participating. If camping costs or 
							equipment are a problem for your family, please talk 
							to the troop treasurer or scoutmaster. Scholarships 
							are available.</p>
 
			    Dues for registered cub scouts joining the troop are $40 to reflect our costs.&nbsp;
